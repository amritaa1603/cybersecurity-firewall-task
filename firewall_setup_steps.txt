# Windows Firewall Setup Task

## Steps Performed
1. Opened Windows Defender Firewall (wf.msc).
2. Viewed current inbound and outbound rules.
3. Created a new rule to block inbound traffic on TCP port 23 (Telnet).
4. Tested using telnet localhost 23 — confirmed block.
5. Optionally allowed SSH (Port 22).
6. Deleted test rule and restored default state.

## Screenshots

- Screenshot_2: Block Telnet rule created.
- Screenshot_3: Telnet blocked test result.

## Summary
Firewalls filter traffic based on rules — inbound rules manage incoming connections, outbound manage outgoing.  
Blocking unused ports like Telnet (23) prevents unauthorized access and strengthens security.
